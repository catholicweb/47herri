  "v1": "Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God,",

  "v6": "When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets were beginning to break.",

  "v8": "But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!”",
  "v9": "For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish that they had taken;",
  "v10": "and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.”",

  "v20": "When he saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.”",
  "v21": "Then the scribes and the Pharisees began to question, “Who is this who is speaking blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”",
  "v22": "When Jesus perceived their questionings, he answered them, “Why do you raise such questions in your hearts?",
  "v23": "Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?",
  "v24": "But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—he said to the one who was paralyzed—“I say to you, stand up and take your bed and go to your home.”",
  "v25": "Immediately he stood up before them, took what he had been lying on, and went to his home, glorifying God.",
  "v26": "Amazement seized all of them, and they glorified God and were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen strange things today.”\n ",

  "v29": "Then Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house; and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them.",
  "v30": "The Pharisees and their scribes were complaining to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”",
  "v31": "Jesus answered, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick;",
  "v32": "I have come to call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.”\n ",
  "v33": "Then they said to him, “John's disciples, like the disciples of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but your disciples eat and drink.”",
  "v34": "Jesus said to them, “You cannot make wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you?",
  "v35": "The days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast in those days.”",
