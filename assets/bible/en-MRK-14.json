  "v5": "For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.” And they scolded her.",
  "v6": "But Jesus said, “Let her alone; why do you trouble her? She has performed a good service for me.",
  "v7": "For you always have the poor with you, and you can show kindness to them whenever you wish; but you will not always have me.",
  "v8": "She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for its burial.",
  "v9": "Truly I tell you, wherever the good news is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in remembrance of her.”\n ",

  "v14": "and wherever he enters, say to the owner of the house, ‘The Teacher asks, Where is my guest room where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’",
  "v15": "He will show you a large room upstairs, furnished and ready. Make preparations for us there.”",

  "v37": "He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour?",
  "v38": "Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”",
  "v39": "And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.",
  "v40": "And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.",

  "v43": "Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived; and with him there was a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.",
  "v44": "Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I will kiss is the man; arrest him and lead him away under guard.”",

  "v50": "All of them deserted him and fled.\n ",
  "v51": "A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They caught hold of him,",

  "v53": "They took Jesus to the high priest; and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes were assembled.",
  "v54": "Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest; and he was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.",
  "v55": "Now the chief priests and the whole council were looking for testimony against Jesus to put him to death; but they found none.",

  "v58": "“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.’ ”",
  "v59": "But even on this point their testimony did not agree.",
  "v60": "Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is it that they testify against you?”",
  "v61": "But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?”",
  "v62": "Jesus said, “I am; and\n ‘you will see the Son of Man\n seated at the right hand of the Power,’\n and ‘coming with the clouds of heaven.’ ”\n ",
