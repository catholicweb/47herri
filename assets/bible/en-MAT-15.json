  "v1": "Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said,",
  "v2": "“Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands before they eat.”",
  "v3": "He answered them, “And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition?",
  "v4": "For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘Whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die.’",
  "v5": "But you say that whoever tells father or mother, ‘Whatever support you might have had from me is given to God,’ then that person need not honor the father.",
  "v6": "So, for the sake of your tradition, you make void the word of God.",
  "v7": "You hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied rightly about you when he said:\n ",
  "v8": "‘This people honors me with their lips,\n but their hearts are far from me;\n ",
  "v9": "in vain do they worship me,\n teaching human precepts as doctrines.’ ”\n ",
  "v10": "Then he called the crowd to him and said to them, “Listen and understand:",
  "v11": "it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles.”",
  "v12": "Then the disciples approached and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?”",
  "v13": "He answered, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.",
  "v14": "Let them alone; they are blind guides of the blind. And if one blind person guides another, both will fall into a pit.”",
  "v15": "But Peter said to him, “Explain this parable to us.”",
  "v16": "Then he said, “Are you also still without understanding?",
  "v17": "Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach, and goes out into the sewer?",
  "v18": "But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this is what defiles.",
  "v19": "For out of the heart come evil intentions, murder, adultery, fornication, theft, false witness, slander.",
  "v20": "These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile.”\n ",
  "v21": "Jesus left that place and went away to the district of Tyre and Sidon.",
  "v22": "Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came out and started shouting, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is tormented by a demon.”",
  "v23": "But he did not answer her at all. And his disciples came and urged him, saying, “Send her away, for she keeps shouting after us.”",
  "v24": "He answered, “I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”",
  "v25": "But she came and knelt before him, saying, “Lord, help me.”",
  "v26": "He answered, “It is not fair to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs.”",
  "v27": "She said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table.”",
  "v28": "Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.” And her daughter was healed instantly.\n ",
  "v29": "After Jesus had left that place, he passed along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up the mountain, where he sat down.",

  "v31": "so that the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the maimed whole, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they praised the God of Israel.\n ",
  "v32": "Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, “I have compassion for the crowd, because they have been with me now for three days and have nothing to eat; and I do not want to send them away hungry, for they might faint on the way.”",
  "v33": "The disciples said to him, “Where are we to get enough bread in the desert to feed so great a crowd?”",
  "v34": "Jesus asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”",
  "v35": "Then ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,",
  "v36": "he took the seven loaves and the fish; and after giving thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.",
