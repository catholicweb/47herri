  "v1": "“I am the true vine, and my Father is the vinegrower.",
  "v2": "He removes every branch in me that bears no fruit. Every branch that bears fruit he prunes to make it bear more fruit.",
  "v3": "You have already been cleansed by the word that I have spoken to you.",
  "v4": "Abide in me as I abide in you. Just as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.",
  "v5": "I am the vine, you are the branches. Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.",
  "v6": "Whoever does not abide in me is thrown away like a branch and withers; such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire, and burned.",

  "v12": "“This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.",
  "v13": "No one has greater love than this, to lay down one's life for one's friends.",
  "v14": "You are my friends if you do what I command you.",
  "v15": "I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father.",
  "v16": "You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask him in my name.",
  "v17": "I am giving you these commands so that you may love one another.\n ",
  "v18": "“If the world hates you, be aware that it hated me before it hated you.",
  "v19": "If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. Because you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world—therefore the world hates you.",
  "v20": "Remember the word that I said to you, ‘Servants are not greater than their master.’ If they persecuted me, they will persecute you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.",
  "v21": "But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me.",
  "v22": "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.",
  "v23": "Whoever hates me hates my Father also.",
  "v24": "If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not have sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.",
