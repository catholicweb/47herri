  "v11": "The woman said to him, “Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?",
  "v12": "Are you greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well, and with his sons and his flocks drank from it?”",
  "v13": "Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again,",

  "v19": "The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.",
  "v20": "Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.”",
  "v21": "Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.",
  "v22": "You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.",
  "v23": "But the hour is coming, and is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such as these to worship him.",

  "v28": "Then the woman left her water jar and went back to the city. She said to the people,",
  "v29": "“Come and see a man who told me everything I have ever done! He cannot be the Messiah, can he?”",

  "v36": "The reaper is already receiving wages and is gathering fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.",
  "v37": "For here the saying holds true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’",
  "v38": "I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”\n ",
  "v39": "Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, “He told me everything I have ever done.”",
  "v40": "So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.",
  "v41": "And many more believed because of his word.",
  "v42": "They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is truly the Savior of the world.”\n ",

  "v45": "When he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, since they had seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the festival; for they too had gone to the festival.\n ",
  "v46": "Then he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine. Now there was a royal official whose son lay ill in Capernaum.",
  "v47": "When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.",

  "v49": "The official said to him, “Sir, come down before my little boy dies.”",

  "v54": "Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.",
