  "v25": "Now some of the people of Jerusalem were saying, “Is not this the man whom they are trying to kill?",

  "v37": "On the last day of the festival, the great day, while Jesus was standing there, he cried out, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me,",
  "v38": "and let the one who believes in me drink. As the scripture has said, ‘Out of the believer's heart shall flow rivers of living water.’ ”",
  "v39": "Now he said this about the Spirit, which believers in him were to receive; for as yet there was no Spirit, because Jesus was not yet glorified.\n ",
