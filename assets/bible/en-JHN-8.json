  "v42": "Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and now I am here. I did not come on my own, but he sent me.",
  "v43": "Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot accept my word.",
  "v44": "You are from your father the devil, and you choose to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.",
  "v45": "But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.",
  "v46": "Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?",
