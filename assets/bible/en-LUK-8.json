  "v10": "He said, “To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but to others I speak in parables, so that\n ‘looking they may not perceive,\n and listening they may not understand.’\n ",
  "v11": "“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.",
  "v12": "The ones on the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.",
  "v13": "The ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it with joy. But these have no root; they believe only for a while and in a time of testing fall away.",

  "v34": "When the swineherds saw what had happened, they ran off and told it in the city and in the country.",
  "v35": "Then people came out to see what had happened, and when they came to Jesus, they found the man from whom the demons had gone sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.",
  "v36": "Those who had seen it told them how the one who had been possessed by demons had been healed.",
  "v37": "Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them; for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.",
  "v38": "The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him; but Jesus sent him away, saying,",
  "v39": "“Return to your home, and declare how much God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the city how much Jesus had done for him.\n ",

  "v43": "Now there was a woman who had been suffering from hemorrhages for twelve years; and though she had spent all she had on physicians, no one could cure her.",
  "v44": "She came up behind him and touched the fringe of his clothes, and immediately her hemorrhage stopped.",

  "v46": "But Jesus said, “Someone touched me; for I noticed that power had gone out from me.”",
  "v47": "When the woman saw that she could not remain hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before him, she declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.",
